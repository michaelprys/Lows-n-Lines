        Meet Michael, the guy behind Lows 'n' Lines, where he's been living and
        breathing these cars for as long as anyone can remember. Growing up, he
        soaked in every detail of lowriding culture, and now he's the go-to guy
        in the neighborhood for turning old-school rides into straight-up
        masterpieces. He's known for his killer designs and serious attention to
        detail.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8">
        When Michael's not in the shop, you'll often spot him rolling down the
        street in his silver 'Tata'.
